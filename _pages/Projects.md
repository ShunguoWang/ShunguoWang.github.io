<b>A new coast effect in marine MT TM-mode data</b> <br>

At low frequencies, the TM-mode coast effect shows as depressed apparent resistivities and unaltered phase. At high frequencies at sufficient distance from the coast it shows, however, as depressed apparent resistivities and negative phases. TM-mode negative phases are an obvious feature of inductive distortion. Thus, the coast effect in marine MT TM-mode data is a combination of galvanic and inductive distortions.
