<br> <b>1. Middle Atlantic Ridge Study with Three-Dimensional Magnetotelluric novel Technique (MARS3DMT)</b>
<br> PI, Funded by the Research Council of Norway (no. 324442)

The main objective of MARS3DMT is to build a reliable three-dimensional resistivity model with magnetotelluric (MT) data at Middle Atlantic Ridge due to its simpler geological history than the continents. The model will improve the understanding of partial melts, melt fraction, and water content beneath the ocean ridges, etc., especially with quantified model uncertainties. Then, the elusive deep structures of Earth, such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), can be better understood. This is crucial for the understanding of the planet and how it operates.

<br> <b>2. Quick Clay Mapping using CSRMT in Rissa</b>
<br> Funded by the Centre of Geophysical Forecasting

SW (NTNU/CGF) and Prof./Dr. Mehrdad Bastani (Uppsala University/SGU) together with other NTNU/CGF researchers have collected controlled-source radio-magnetotelluric (CSRMT) data in Rissa to study quick clays. In 1978, quick clay liqufication caused a large landslide in Rissa, so that it is naturally an ideal location to study quick clay and relevant landslide. The electrical resistivity property of quick clays is different from that of the surrounding marine clays. Therefore, CSRMT, sensitive to resistivity, is one of the ideal methods to map quick clays. A short field course is also combined with the fieldwork. The photo shows Prof./Dr. Bastani is giving a lecture to CGF researchers and Ph.D. students on CSRMT (the transmitter shown in the photo).
