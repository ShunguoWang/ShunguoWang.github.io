<b>A new coase effect in marine MT TM-mode data</b> <br>

At low frequencies, the TM-mode coast effect shows as depressed apparent resistivities and unaltered phase. At high frequencies at sufficient distance from the coast it shows, however, as depressed apparent resistivities and negative phases. TM-mode negative phases are an obvious feature of inductive distortion. Thus, the coast effect in marine MT TM-mode data is a combination of galvanic and inductive distortions.

<b>Using CSAMT and RMT to map fracture zones</b> <br>

Joint utilization of boat-towed radio-magnetotellurics (RMT) and controlled-source audio-magnetotellurics (CSAMT) was tested for the first time at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) site in south-eastern Sweden to demonstrate acquisition efficiency and improved resolution to model fracture zones along a 600-m-long profile. The 2D joint inversions of RMT and CSAMT data show clear improvement compared with 2D single inversions, especially in imaging uncertain fracture zones.
